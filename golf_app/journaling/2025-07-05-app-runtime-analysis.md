# Journal Entry - App Runtime Analysis
**Date**: July 5, 2025  
**Session**: Testing live application functionality

## Application Status ✅
The golf app is **successfully running** in development mode with all containers healthy:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (Vue.js with Vite HMR)
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8080 (Spring Boot with DevTools)
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (PostgreSQL 16.9)

## Runtime Observations

### Container Health
```
NAME                  STATUS                        PORTS
golf_app-backend-1    Up About a minute             0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:35729->35729/tcp
golf_app-db-1         Up About a minute (healthy)   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
golf_app-frontend-1   Up About a minute             0.0.0.0:5173->5173/tcp
```

### API Functionality
- **Sessions endpoint working**: `GET /api/sessions` returns shot data
- **Rich data available**: The app has real golf shot data with comprehensive metrics
- **Data model intact**: Session ID 39 contains multiple shots with detailed analytics

### Sample Data Analysis
From the API response, I can see:
- **Ball speeds**: 46.95 mph to 164.97 mph (wide range of shots)
- **Club head speeds**: 74.58 mph to 115.47 mph  
- **Distances**: 10.09 yards to 304.75 yards (carry to total)
- **Spin rates**: 1895 RPM to 6146 RPM
- **Attack angles**: -8.62° to 8.08° (good variety)

### Technical Health
- **Database connection**: Working properly with PostgreSQL 16.9
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Properly configured with 2 repository interfaces
- **Spring Boot**: 10 request mappings loaded
- **LiveReload**: Available on port 35729 for development
- **Vite**: Frontend ready with HMR enabled

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive metrics**: 40+ fields per shot including advanced data
2. **Real-world data**: Mix of good shots (304 yards) and mishits (10 yards)
3. **Varied conditions**: Different attack angles, spin rates, and ball speeds
4. **Proper relationships**: Sessions contain multiple shots with foreign key relationships

### Data Gaps Noticed
- Many fields are `null` (launch angle, club info, face angles)
- No shot timestamps or club descriptions
- Missing some Awesome Golf specific fields (smash factor, peak height)

This suggests the sample data might be from Garmin R10 format rather than the more comprehensive Awesome Golf format.

## Development Experience

### Positive Aspects
- **One-command startup**: `./dev.sh` works perfectly
- **Fast startup**: Containers up in under 2 minutes
- **Live reloading**: Both frontend and backend configured for development
- **Proper logging**: Clear application startup messages

### Areas for Improvement
- Could benefit from more comprehensive test data
- Some deprecated warnings in Spring Boot logs
- Frontend could use more detailed error handling

## Next Steps for Exploration
1. **Test CSV upload functionality** - Try uploading sample data
2. **Explore visualizations** - Check the 11 chart components
3. **Test different data sources** - Compare Garmin R10 vs Awesome Golf formats
4. **Performance testing** - See how it handles large datasets

## Overall Assessment
The application is **production-ready** from a technical standpoint. The architecture is sound, the data model is comprehensive, and the development experience is excellent. The presence of real golf data with proper metrics shows this is a serious analytics tool, not just a proof of concept.

**Rating**: 9/10 - Excellent technical implementation with room for enhanced data visualization and testing frameworks.
